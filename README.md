# Automated-Gene-Pathway-Enrichment-Analysis-with-STRING-API
This Python script automates the process of gene pathway enrichment analysis by integrating with the STRING Database API. It reads a list of genes from an input Excel file, queries the STRING database for biological enrichment data, filters relevant results, and outputs the findings into a new Excel file for downstream analysis.
